# SepiaPets

About Project: 
My experience is quite good at implementing this challenging task. The whole project is implemented using SwiftUI. Used github for project implementation, created separate branch for each feature, merge feature branch into the develop to keep track of commits.


Initially, when the user launches the app at that time, startUpVC will display to all users with button "Display Pet List". On that screen, I'll collect the pet-list and config data. One the user clicks on the button at that time, the app will check the working hours and display the pet list during the working hours. In the case of non-working hours, the user can see the alert message and can not access any further information.

On pet details page, I found the web url, so in that case I'm using webview to display pet details. In addition, I implemented the webview using UIViewPresentable. The reason why I'm using it is because features are not available in the SwiftUI.
